# Void Codebase Guide

The Void codebase is not as intimidating as it seems!

Most of Void's code lives in the folder `src/vs/workbench/contrib/void/`.

The purpose of this document is to explain how Void's codebase works. If you want build instructions, see [Contributing](https://github.com/voideditor/void/blob/main/HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md).



## Void Codebase Guide

### Terminology

Here is some important terminology you should know if you're working inside VSCode:
- An **Editor** is the thing that you type your code in. If you have 10 tabs open, that's just one editor! Editors contain tabs (or "models").
- A **Model** is an internal representation of a file's contents. It's shared between editors (for example, if you press `Cmd+\` to make a new editor, then the model of a file like `A.ts` is shared between them. Two editors, one model. That's how changes sync.).
- Each model has a **URI** it represents, like `/Users/.../my_file.txt`. (A URI or "resource" is generally just a path).
- The **Workbench** is the wrapper that contains all the editors, the terminal, the file system tree, etc.
- Usually you use the `ITextModel` type for models and the `ICodeEditor` type for editors. There aren't that many other types.



### Minimal VSCode Rundown
Here's a minimal VSCode rundown if you're just getting started with Void:

- VSCode is (and therefore Void is) an Electron app. Electron runs two processes: a **main** process (for internals) and a **browser** process (browser means HTML in general, not just "web browser").
- Code in a  `browser/` folder always lives on the browser process, and it can use `window` and other browser items.
- Code in an `electron-main/` folder always lives on the main process, and it can import `node_modules`.
- Code in `common/` can be used by either process, but doesn't get any special imports.
- The browser environment is not allowed to import `node_modules`, but there are two workarounds:
  1. Bundle the raw node_module code to the browser - we're doing this for React.
  2. Implement the code on `electron-main/` and set up a channel between main/browser - we're doing this for sendLLMMessage.



VSCode is organized into "Services". A service is just a class that mounts a single time (in computer science theory this is called a "singleton"). You can register services with `registerSingleton` so that you can easily use them in any constructor with `@<Service>`. See _dummyContrib for an example we put together on how to register them. The registration is the same every time.

Services are always lazily created, even if you register them as Eager. If you want something that always runs on Void's mount, you should use a "workbench contribution". See _dummyContrib for this. Very similar to a Service, just registered slightly differently.

Actions or "commands" are functions you register on VSCode so that either you or the user can call them later. You can run actions as a user by pressing Cmd+Shift+P (opens the command pallete), or you can run them internally by using the commandService to call them by ID. We use actions to register keybinding listeners like Cmd+L, Cmd+K, etc. The nice thing about actions is the user can change the keybindings.


See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Source-Code-Organization) for a decent VSCode guide with even more info.


Each section below contains an overview of a core part of Void's sourcecode. You might want to scroll to find the item that's relevant to you.

### Internal LLM Message Pipeline

Here's a picture of all the dependencies that are relevent between the time you first send a message through Void's sidebar, and the time a request is sent to your provider.
Sending LLM messages from the main process avoids CSP issues with local providers and lets us use node_modules more easily.

</div>



**Notes:** `modelCapabilities` is an important file that must be updated when new models come out! 


### Apply

Void has two types of Apply: **Fast Apply** (uses Search/Replace, see below), and **Slow Apply** (rewrites whole file).

When you click Apply and Fast Apply is enabled, we prompt the LLM to output Search/Replace block(s) like this:
```
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
// original code goes here 
=======
// replaced code goes here
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
This is what allows Void to quickly apply code even on 1000-line files. It's the same as asking the LLM to press Ctrl+F and enter in a search/replace query. 

### Apply Inner Workings

The `editCodeService` file runs Apply. The same exact code is also used when the LLM calls the Edit tool, and when you submit Cmd+K. Just different versions of Fast/Slow Apply mode. 

Here is some important terminology:
- A **DiffZone** is a {startLine, endLine} region in which we show Diffs (red/green areas). We update it when the user types, so it's always accurate.
- A **DiffArea** is a generalization that tracks line numbers like a DiffZone.
- The only type of zone that can "stream" is a DiffZone. Each DiffZone has an llmCancelToken if it's streaming.
- When you click Apply, we create a **DiffZone** over that the full file so that any changes that the LLM makes will show up in red/green. We then stream the change.
- When an LLM calls Edit, it's really calling Apply.
- When you submit Cmd+K, it's the same as Apply except we create a smaller DiffZone (not on the whole file).

### Writing Files Inner Workings
When Void wants to change your code, it just writes to a text model. This means all you need to know to write to a file is its URI - you don't have to load it, save it, etc. There are some annoying background URI/model things to think about to get this to work, but we handled them all in `voidModelService`.

### Void Settings Inner Workings
We have a service `voidSettingsService` that stores all your Void settings (providers, models, global Void settings, etc). Imagine this as an implicit dependency for any of the core Void services:

<div align="center">
	<img width="800" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f3cb68c-a61b-4810-8429-bb90b992b3fa">
</div>

Here's a guide to some of the terminology we're using:
- **FeatureName**: Autocomplete | Chat | CtrlK | Apply
- **ModelSelection**: a {providerName, modelName} pair.
- **ProviderName**: The name of a provider: `'ollama'`, `'openAI'`, etc.
- **ModelName**: The name of a model (string type, eg `'gpt-4o'`). 
- **RefreshProvider**: a provider that we ping repeatedly to update the models list.
- **ChatMode** = normal | gather | agent



### Approval State
`editCodeService`'s data structures contain all the information about changes that the user needs to review. However, they don't store that information in a useful format. We wrote the following service to get a more useful derived state:

## VSCode Codebase Guide (Not Void)

The Void team put together this list of links to get up and running with VSCode's sourcecode, the foundation of Void. We hope it's helpful!

#### Links for Beginners

- [VSCode UI guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)  - covers auxbar, panels, etc.

- [UX guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/overview) - covers Containers, Views, Items, etc.

#### Links for Contributors

- [How VSCode's sourcecode is organized](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Source-Code-Organization) - this explains where the entry point files are, what `browser/` and `common/` mean, etc. This is the most important read on this whole list! We recommend reading the whole thing.

- [Built-in VSCode styles](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) - CSS variables that are built into VSCode. Use `var(--vscode-{theme but replacing . with -})`. You can also see their [Webview theming guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview#theming-webview-content).


#### Misc

- [Every command](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/commands) built-in to VSCode - not used often, but here for reference.

- Note: VSCode's repo is the source code for the Monaco editor! An "editor" is a Monaco editor, and it shares the code for ITextModel, etc.


#### VSCode's Extension API

Void is no longer an extension, so these links are no longer required, but they might be useful if we ever build an extension again.

- [Files you need in an extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/extension-anatomy).

- [An extension's `package.json` schema](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/extension-manifest).

- ["Contributes" Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points) - the `"contributes"` part of `package.json` is how an extension mounts.

- [The Full VSCode Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api) - look on the right side for organization. The [bottom](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#api-patterns) of the page is easy to miss but is useful - cancellation tokens, events, disposables.

- [Activation events](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events) you can define in `package.json` (not the most useful).
